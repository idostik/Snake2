# Snake2
## High school graduation project

This was my final high school project from computer science. I created the game of Snake with one major change - you compete against other snake that is controlled by AI and your goal is to outlast him and make him crash. For more details read the attached paper *MaturitniPrace.pdf*.

*Disclaimer: I wrote this project a long time ago. It was one of my first bigger programming projects and I was just getting familiar with programming. I think that my programming skills have improved greatly since then.*
